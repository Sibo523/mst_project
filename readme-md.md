# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Project

This project implements various Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms and provides a server for solving MST problems on weighted, directed graphs.

## Features

- Graph data structure implementation
- MST algorithms:
  - Bor≈Øvka's algorithm
  - Prim's algorithm
  - Kruskal's algorithm
  - Tarjan's algorithm
- Server for handling MST requests
- Asynchronous processing using Proactor pattern
- Comprehensive MST analysis

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 7+ or Clang 5+)
- Make
- lcov (for code coverage reports)
- gprof (for profiling)

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```
make
```

This will create the `mst_project` executable in the project root directory.

## Running Tests

To build and run the tests, use:

```
make test
```

## Code Coverage

To generate a code coverage report, run:

```
make coverage
```

This will create a coverage report in the `coverage_report` directory.

## Profiling

To profile the application, use:

```
make profile
```

This will generate a `profile_report.txt` file with profiling information.

## Running the Application

After building, you can run the application with:

```
./mst_project
```

The application accepts the following commands:

- `addGraph <num_vertices> <src> <dest> <weight> ...`: Add a new graph
- `updateGraph <src> <dest> <new_weight>`: Update an edge in the current graph
- `solveMST <algorithm>`: Solve MST using specified algorithm (Boruvka, Prim, Kruskal, or Tarjan)

Example usage:

```
./mst_project
addGraph 4 0 1 10 0 2 6 0 3 5 1 3 15 2 3 4
solveMST Prim
```
